# PE01 - Hello World ðŸ‘‹

## Input, Process, Output

### Input
The app takes user interactions as input, such as navigation between tabs or interacting with collapsible sections. Additionally, it uses static assets like images and text defined in the codebase.

### Process
The app processes the input using React Native components and Expo's framework. It renders UI elements dynamically based on the input and applies styles using `StyleSheet`. The app also supports features like light/dark mode, animations, and platform-specific behavior (e.g., iOS vs. Android).

### Output
The output is a responsive and interactive user interface displayed on Android, iOS, or the web. The app shows a yellow background with centered text ("Enkh Baterdene,\nMSCS\nSTC") on the home page and provides additional functionality on other tabs, such as collapsible sections and external links.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
