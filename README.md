### Input
The app takes user interactions as input, such as navigation between tabs or interacting with collapsible sections. Additionally, it uses static assets like images and text defined in the codebase.

### Process
The app processes the input using React Native components and Expo's framework. It renders UI elements dynamically based on the input and applies styles using `StyleSheet`. The app also supports features like light/dark mode, animations, and platform-specific behavior (e.g., iOS vs. Android).

### Output
The output is a responsive and interactive user interface displayed on Android, iOS, or the web. The app shows a yellow background with centered text ("Enkh Baterdene,\nMSCS\nSTC") on the home page and provides additional functionality on other tabs, such as collapsible sections and external links.
