## 2. PE02-Core Components

### Input
The app allows users to input their favorite course using a `TextInput` field. It also uses static assets, such as an image of the React logo, and displays predefined course information for MSCS programs.

### Process
The app processes the input by updating the state (`favoriteCourse`) using React's `useState` hook. It logs the input to the console using the `useEffect` hook whenever the input changes. The app uses core React Native components like `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `Image`, `TextInput`, and `StyleSheet` to render a scrollable and styled user interface.

### Output
The app outputs a scrollable screen displaying MSCS course categories (Core Requirements, Depth of Study, and Capstone) with styled section titles. It also displays the userâ€™s favorite course in the console log whenever the input changes.

## Analysis Report

The program follows the input-process-output model effectively. Users provide input through a `TextInput` field, which updates the state dynamically. The app processes this input using React Native's state management (`useState`) and side effects (`useEffect`) to log the input to the console. The app uses React Native's core components to render a visually appealing and scrollable interface, ensuring compatibility across platforms (iOS, Android). The output is a responsive UI that displays MSCS course details and logs user input in real time. The use of `StyleSheet` ensures consistent styling, while `ScrollView` makes the interface user-friendly for long content. This design demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with input handling, processing, and output rendering working seamlessly together.




## Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
